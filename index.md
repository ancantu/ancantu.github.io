I'm currently a first-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University. Under the supervision of Dr. Vicky Yao, I am studying alternative splicing differences across Alzheimer's Disease-associated cell-types.

I graduated from Brown University with an A.B. in Computational Biology in 2018. Prior to beginning my Ph.D. program, I worked as a Computational Biologist at the Texas Advanced Computing Center.

Outside of academia, my hobbies include crocheting, painting, point-and-shoot film photography, and sewing. Currently, I am learning digital illustration, 3D modeling, and how to swim.
