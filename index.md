I'm currently a third year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at Rice University. I am generously funded by the NSF CSGrad4US program as one of its inaugural fellows. Under the supervision of Dr. Vicky Yao, I am studying alternative splicing differences across Alzheimer's Disease-associated cell types.
