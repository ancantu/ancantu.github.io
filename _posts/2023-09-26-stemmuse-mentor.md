title: "Started Mentoring with the STEM Muse Mentorship Program"
---

This fall, I began my role as a mentor with the STEM Muse Mentorship Program, a program supporting women and people with underrepresented genders in STEM fields at UT Austin and ACC. I have provided mentorship in acquiring skills in computational biology, exploring career paths post-undergrad, and navigating graduate school applications.
