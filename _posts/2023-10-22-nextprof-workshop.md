title: "Attended the 2023 NextProf Pathfinder Workshop"
---

This fall, I attended the 2023 NextProf Pathfinder workshop. With programming dedicated to preparing PhD students for a succesful career in academia, NextProf Pathfinder taught me skills to succeed in a PhD program and become a competitive applicant for the faculty job market. I was very fortunate to have been one of fifty students selected for this opportunity.
