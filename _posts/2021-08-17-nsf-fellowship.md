title: "Received the NSF CSGrad4US Fellowship"
---

I've been selected into the first cohort of [NSF CSGrad4US](https://www.nsf.gov/cise/CSGrad4US/) fellows, a three-year fellowship award with funding similar to the GRFP. I began the mentoring component of the fellowship program in 2021 and anticipate my funding to begin in summer 2023. 

My recipient status has been featured in Brown CS News. Check it out [here](https://cs.brown.edu/news/2022/09/22/brown-cs-alums-steven-shi-and-alyssa-cantu-receive-nsf-csgrad4us-fellowships/).
