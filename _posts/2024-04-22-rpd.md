title: "Passed My Research Project Defense"
---

I passed my Research Project Defense (RPD), the second milestone of my program. The RPD is an exam presented in front of a committee that covers both research progress and background knowledge. I am now able to proceed to completing my PhD proposal, the third milestone of my program.
